readme:
FWHomework1 is the 2nd to last assignment I forgot to turn in. FWHomework2 is the last homework assignment.


bugs:
in returnHeartRateConcern there is an error in detecting a FAIR heart rate between and including 90 and 120. 
The code was set for < 120 which did not include the 120 value. I changed it to <121 and fixed the bug.

in returnTemperatureConcern there is an error in returning a FAIR temperature between and including 34 and 35. 
The code returning GOOD when it should be returning FAIR. I changed it to FAIR and fixed the bug.

transition from ALERT_DOCTOR to ALERT_USER fails in test 06
corrected by resetting the state counters when in the alertStatus = ALERT_DOCTOR state.
