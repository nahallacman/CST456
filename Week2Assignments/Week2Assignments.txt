Week 2 Assignments
	
	-Read Chapter 2 of “SystemVerilog for Verification”.

	Lab 1 Part 1 (Firmware)
	----------------------
	
	Create a program (lab1.asm) in 68HC11 assembly language to exhaustively test the following instructions:
		- ldaa
		- ldab
		- staa
		- stab
		- coma
		- comb
	
	You can write a simple script to populate the assembly program with each of the 256 enumerated values for each instruction.
	Run "build.bat" to assemble the program and convert the "lab1.s19" file to a format usable by the Verilog simulator (lab1.txt).
	
	
	Lab 1 Part 2 (Hardware)
	-----------------------
	
	Load www.edaplayground.com using your favorite web browser.
	Copy and paste the contents of "lab1.v" to the "testbench.sv" window of edaplayground.
	Copy and paste the contents of "hc11core.v" to the "design.sv" window of edaplayground.	
	Change the value of MAX_INDEX to 256, since you are testing all 256 enumerations of an instruction.	
	Copy and paste the contents of "lab1.txt" to the int_ram module. Your assembly program now resides in the micocontroller's RAM space.	
	Expand the checking logic in the hc11_test module to include all six instructions.
	
	The microcontroller core works correctly for the six instructions. Your test should not find any hardware errors.

	Copy and paste the contents of "testbench.sv" back to "lab1.v" for submission.

Submit the "lab1.asm" and "lab1.v" files via e-mail to steven.bellock@oit.edu
Assignment is due by January 24th at 6 PM.
