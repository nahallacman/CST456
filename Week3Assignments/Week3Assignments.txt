Week 3 Assignment
	
	Lab 1 Part 3
	------------
	
	The file "hc11core_bug.v" contains a 68HC11 cpu core with exactly one design flaw. Run your test program on the design to see what instructions are affected by the flaw.
	Then isolate the flaw to either a specific instruction (LDAA, LDAB, STAA, STAB, COMA, COMB) or register (ACCA, ACCB). To help you do this you can use the TAB (transfer
	contents of ACCA to ACCB) or TBA (transfer contents of ACCB to ACCA) instructions and assume they are working correctly.
	
	Create a document answering the following questions:
	
		1) What instructions or registers in your test are affected by the design flaw?
		2) What specific instruction or register contains the design flaw?
		3) What is the signature / nature of the design flaw? (stuck bit, inverted bit, etc)
		4) Where in "hc11core_bug.v" is the design flaw located? (This is straight forward to do once you know which instruction or register contains the flaw.)
